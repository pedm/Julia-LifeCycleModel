# Current Todo List:
- Create event study around negative shocks:
    - prob of withdrawal
    - wealth accumulation 
    - consumption 
    - savings 
    - propensity to spend out of withdrawn assets 
- add unemployment -> create similar event studies
- update the tax function
- Annuity for after retirement 
- withdrawal tax: 60% working life then 40% retirement 


# Later Todo List:

## Model features
- later: some way of capturing first and second pilars in the model 
- later: how pensions enter the tax function 
- later: liquid returns that depend on the amount of assets you hold 
- later: explicit tax differences between the two accounts 
- later: govt budget constraint 
- make the liquid return depend on current liquid assets
- Pluto.jl for the tests?
- Do we want to allow liquid borrowing? 
- Do we want to set the liquid interest rate based on assets?
- Add in the reform (lower early withdrawal penalty)

## Calibration
- do we know any papers that estimate the income process in DK? any parameters we can take from elsewhere? https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/iere.12534
- What else to target?
    - Prob of withdrawal by income decile? by liquid asset decile? 
    - Deposits to the illiquid account by age
    - Liquid assets by age
